# YACCS

A command service which is highly customizable and can accept any form of input after being converted to [IContext](https://github.com/advorange/YACCS/blob/master/src/YACCS/Commands/IContext.cs).

Yet another custom command service inspired by [Discord.Net.Commands](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net/tree/dev/src/Discord.Net.Commands).

## Examples
